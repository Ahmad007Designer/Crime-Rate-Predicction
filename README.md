Crime Rate Predictor is an application that leverages machine learning to predict crime rates in various locations. The project aims to assist law enforcement agencies and policymakers in understanding crime trends, improving resource allocation, and enhancing public safety.

üìå About the Application
Crime rate prediction has become an essential tool for law enforcement agencies, helping them anticipate crime patterns and allocate resources effectively. By analyzing historical crime data, this application predicts future crime trends, enabling authorities to take preventive measures and improve community security.
The dataset is compiled from various sources, including official crime reports and publicly available statistics. Using advanced machine learning models, the application forecasts crime rates for multiple categories in specific regions over the coming years.
Data Features
- Crime Categories: Predicts different types of crime such as theft, assault, fraud, and cybercrimes.
- Geographical Coverage: Analyzes crime data in multiple regions for better insights.
- Historical Data: Uses past crime records for accurate forecasting.
Machine Learning Approach
The system employs Random Forest Regression, an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions. This method enhances accuracy compared to traditional models. The algorithm achieves high precision in crime rate forecasting based on historical patterns and influencing factors.
